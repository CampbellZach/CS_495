important and visually historic buildings in Gunnison, located at 102 South Main Street. The building has served many purposes over the years. It started as offices for the Rio Grande railroad system, and as a hotel on the second floor. In 1888, the building became a hardware store and even though it changed owners three times, the building remained a hardware store until it became a ski and sports store in 1971. The building even served as a restaurant and bar for a few years. In 1989, the building became the Gunnison Arts Center and, shortly after, was restored into the historical landmark that is present today.</span></p><p class="c6 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c5 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The Gunnison Arts Center (GAC) was constructed in&nbsp;1882 and is listed on the Colorado State Historic&nbsp;Register as one of the most important and visible historic structures on the south end of the Gunnison Valley.&nbsp;This building is on the State Register of historic&nbsp;landmarks.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Originally, the Gunnison Arts Center&rsquo;s building was financed by Mary Mechling, for whom the original&nbsp;building was named after. Mechling purchased the lot in&nbsp;1880 and two years later had the building constructed by&nbsp;Fredrick Zugelder, a highly respected local master&nbsp;stonemason and stonecutter, and his partner Thomas&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Russell. Upon its completion, the first floor became the rail freight offices for the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway. At&nbsp;the same time, the second floor served as private rooms for the European Hotel. According to local lore, many people believed the hotel also operated as a brothel, but these stories are not confirmed.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In&nbsp;1888, Mechling sold the building to F.D. Steel, who owned the Gunnison Hardware Company, and used the building as their new storefront.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The&nbsp;Steel family ran their business out of the building&nbsp;until&nbsp;1931, when W.J. Diog bought the property and continued to&nbsp;use the building as a hardware store. </span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Sometime between&nbsp;1940 and 1951, Alex Campbell took charge of the&nbsp;building&rsquo;s title, and continued to operate a hardware store out of the building.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In&nbsp;1960 the hardware store changed hands once again, this&nbsp;time to Clayton Hansen. Hansen continued the hardware store, adding motor repair to the services offered, and manufactured his own Hansen Weather ports as well.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In&nbsp;1971, Leo and Judy Klinker purchased the building and changed it from the hardware store to&nbsp;their Klinkerhaus Ski and Sports store. Klinkerhaus&nbsp;Ski and Sports closed its doors in Gunnison, and the Klinkers rented the building to Three Thieves restaurant for a couple of years. When the Three Thieves restaurant folded around&nbsp;1979, the Klinker family started their own&nbsp;restaurant and bar called Klink&rsquo;s Place. Klink&rsquo;s Place operated in the building from&nbsp;1980-1988, until the building&nbsp;fell into bank receivership.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In&nbsp;1989 the Gunnison Council for the Arts entered into a lease/purchase option agreement with the First&nbsp;National Bank of Gunnison.

After a fundraising campaign in&nbsp;1992, the council was able to purchase the building&nbsp;outright, and the Gunnison Arts Center was established.&nbsp;In the mid to late 90s the building got funding to restore the building to its original fa&ccedil;ade as seen today.</span></li><li class="c3 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The history of the Art Center Building reflects economic and cultural trends in Gunnison&rsquo;s history.

Secondly,&nbsp;used as a hardware store for decades, the building&rsquo;s usage demonstrates the need for hardware goods to enable&nbsp;Gunnison residents to build and fix their homes, ranches, and businesses, transforming Gunnison from a&nbsp;transport hub to a town. As a ski shop and restaurant, the building&rsquo;s usage reflects the growing tourism boom of&nbsp;the mid to late twentieth century that grew with the newly developed Crested Butte Mountain Ski Resort and Blue&nbsp;Mesa Reservoir.

        <p>Introduction: Originally built in 1882, the Gunnison Arts Center is one of the most important and visually historic buildings in Gunnison, located at 102 South Main Street. The building has served many purposes over the years. It started as offices for the Rio Grande railroad system, and as a hotel on the second floor. In 1888, the building became a hardware store and even though it changed owners three times, the building remained a hardware store until it became a ski and sports store in 1971. The building even served as a restaurant and bar for a few years. In 1989, the building became the Gunnison Arts Center and, shortly after, was restored into the historical landmark that is present today.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li>The Gunnison Arts Center (GAC) was constructed in 1882 and is listed on the Colorado State Historic Register as one of the most important and visible historic structures on the south end of the Gunnison Valley. This building is on the State Register of historic landmarks.</li>
            <li>Originally, the Gunnison Arts Center's building was financed by Mary Mechling, for whom the original building was named after. Mechling purchased the lot in 1880 and two years later had the building constructed by Fredrick Zugelder, a highly respected local master stonemason and stonecutter, and his partner Thomas D. Russell. Upon its completion, the first floor became the rail freight offices for the Denver Rio Grande Railway. At the same time, the second floor served as private rooms for the European Hotel. According to local lore, many people believed the hotel also operated as a brothel, but these stories are not confirmed.</li>
            <li>In 1888, Mechling sold the building to F.D. Steel, who owned the Gunnison Hardware Company, and used the building as their new storefront.</li>
            <li>The Steel family ran their business out of the building until 1931, when W.J. Diog bought the property and continued to use the building as a hardware store.</li>
            <li>Sometime between 1940 and 1951, Alex Campbell took charge of the building's title, and continued to operate a hardware store out of the building.</li>
            <li>In 1960 the hardware store changed hands once again, this time to Clayton Hansen. Hansen continued the hardware store, adding motor repair to the services offered, and manufactured his own Hansen Weather ports as well.</li>
            <li>In 1971, Leo and Judy Klinker purchased the building and changed it from the hardware store to their Klinkerhaus Ski and Sports store. Klinkerhaus Ski and Sports closed its doors in Gunnison, and the Klinkers rented the building to Three Thieves restaurant for a couple of years. When the Three Thieves restaurant folded around 1979, the Klinker family started their own restaurant and bar called Klink's Place. Klink's Place operated in the building from 1980-1988, until the building fell into bank receivership.</li>
            <li>In 1989 the Gunnison Council for the Arts entered into a lease/purchase option agreement with the First National Bank of Gunnison. The Council immediately began using the building as its arts center without making any physical changes. After a fundraising campaign in 1992, the council was able to purchase the building outright, and the Gunnison Arts Center was established. In the mid to late 90s the building got funding to restore the building to its original fa√ßade as seen today.</li>
            <li>The history of the Art Center Building reflects economic and cultural trends in Gunnison's history. First, created and used by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, the building reflects the progressive beginnings of the town as it emerged from a dusty settlement to an economic transportation hub for the mineral rich area. Secondly, used as a hardware store for decades, the building's usage demonstrates the need for hardware goods to enable Gunnison residents to build and fix their homes, ranches, and businesses, transforming Gunnison from a transport hub to a town. As a ski shop and restaurant, the building's usage reflects the growing tourism boom of the mid to late twentieth century that grew with the newly developed Crested Butte Mountain Ski Resort and Blue Mesa Reservoir. Under ownership by the Gunnison Art Center, the building reflects Gunnison's growing arts scene, which is important to the cultural development of the Gunnison Valley.</li>

            <p>Introduction: The Johnson Building located at 124 Main St. Gunnison finished construction in 1881. This building has had many different purposes it is the oldest intact commercial building in Gunnison. In 1881 the building was bought for $250 dollars and then was sold very soon after for $800 dollars. The building had different purposes from 1881 to 1901 like a lunchroom and bakery. In 1901 it was sold and became a restaurant and the top floor a living space the restaurant was called the royal cafe. Shortly after in 1904 the restaurant was traded hand and leased out to the Johnson family becoming the Johnson restaurant. The building continued to be a restaurant for over 80 years staying in the Johnson family. In the 1990's the building was sold and restored and now runs as a gallery on the first floor and offices on the second.</p>

            <p>The property on which the Johnson Building was built changed hands seven times in 1880 with the price fluctuating from $20 to $275. Then in 1881 the building was built on the property and Mary Thomas bought it for $250, immediately selling it for $800. Walker Burkett bought the building and the property in 1901, and when Effie Jane Lashbrook arrived in Gunnison with her sick husband and children in 1901, she took over the empty building. She turned the lower floor into a restaurant and made living quarters for her family upstairs and named the restaurant the Royal Cafe. Burnett leased the building to Sam and Anna Francis (Frankie) Johnson for their restaurant in 1904 and at that time, it became the Johnson Restaurant. Johnson's bought the building on October 20, 1920. Sam and Frankie (after Sam's death in 1923) continued the restaurant until Frankie died in 1942. Their daughter Sarah Trine and her husband Harry bought her brother's share. Sarah continued to operate the restaurant (summers only in later years) until 1985. In 1996, the Tredway family bought the Johnson Building from Sarah Trine. They have restored and renovated both floors of the building. The lower floor is now a Gallery where many of the original antiques are on display. The upper floors are offices.</p>

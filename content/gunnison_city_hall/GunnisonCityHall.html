        <p>Introduction: The Gunnison City Hall, located at 201 West Virginia Avenue, finished construction in under a year in 1932. It has been the primary location for the Gunnison city government for nearly a century, and very little has changed to the original design. This unique building is an example of Art Deco, an architecture style that is rare on the western slope. The Denver architecture firm, Mountjoy and Frewen, is responsible for designing the building and it has been on the State Register of Historic Landmarks since 1998.</span></p>

            <li>The Town Council of Gunnison appropriated $25,000 for construction of the Town Hall in April 1931 and work began in June of that year. The building at the time housed the hose house and fire station, jail, marshal's office, council room, vaults, private offices, treasurer's office and a municipal store selling light and water equipment. The second-floor use was not determined at the time it was built.</li>
            <li>Members of the community volunteered to begin excavation for the building's foundation, which was later completed by Danielson and Son, a construction firm from Denver. Construction was completed in February of 1932 and the town offices took occupancy.</li>
            <li>The original details and Art Deco style have been maintained throughout the years with minor renovations. The most significant alterations to the exterior of the building were undertaken in 1967: the fire prevention function of the building was relocated, and the facility was remodeled to accommodate office space.</li>
            <li>Other minor renovations occurred in the 1970s, including the addition of aluminum storm windows, new aluminum entrance doors on the north and east facades, and a small concrete masonry building on the southwest corner of the building to house the City's emergency generator.</li>
            <li>The roof was replaced in 1987 with an adhered single ply EPDM roof.</li>
            <li>The exterior of the building has been painted several times over the years with colors similar to the original paint.</li>
            <li>The Gunnison Municipal Building is an architecturally significant historic structure because of its 1930s Art Deco style and detailing that has remained intact over the past sixty years. It also represents a rare western slope example of Art Deco period architecture applied to a governmental structure in which the building has maintained its original character.</li>
